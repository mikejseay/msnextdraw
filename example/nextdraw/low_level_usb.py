low_level_usb.py

Demonstrate advanced features of nextdraw python module in "interactive" mode.


This demo file shows off the "usb_command" and "usb_query" features of
the interactive API. Interaction through these two commands essentially bypass
all software counters, speed, position, and limit checks that otherwise
ensure safe operations.

While these two "low-level USB" serial interface functions are very direct, they are also
powerful and potentially dangerous. They should be used with reluctance and caution,
since improper use is capable of causing damage of an unpredictable nature.

The serial protocol is documented at:
http://evil-mad.github.io/EggBot/ebb.html


This particular example file demonstrates:
* Moving the carriage away from the home position via moveto
* Querying and printing the firmware version via usb_query
* Querying and printing the step position via usb_query
* Returning to the home position via usb_command


Run this demo by calling: python low_level_usb.py

About the interactive API:

Interactive mode is a mode of use, designed for plotting individual motion
segments upon request, using direct XY control. It is a complement to the
usual plotting modes, which take an SVG document as input.

So long as the NextDraw is started in the home corner, moves are limit checked,
and constrained to be within the safe travel range of the NextDraw.
