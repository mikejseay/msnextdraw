plot.py

Demonstrate use of nextdraw module in "plot" mode, to plot an SVG file.

Run this demo by calling: python plot.py


This is a minimal example to show how one can import the NextDraw module
and use it to plot an SVG file with the NextDraw.

(There is also a separate "interactive" mode, which can be used for moving
the NextDraw to various points upon command, rather than plotting an SVG file.)
