Demonstrate use of nextdraw module in "interactive" mode.

Run this demo by calling: python interactive_xy.py


---------------------------------------------------------------------

About the interactive API:

Interactive mode is a mode of use, designed for plotting individual motion
segments upon request, using direct XY control. It is a complement to the
usual plotting modes, which take an SVG document as input.

So long as the NextDraw is started in the home corner, moves are limit checked,
and constrained to be within the safe travel range of the NextDraw.
