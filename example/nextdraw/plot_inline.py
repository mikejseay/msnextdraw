plot_inline.py

Demonstrate use of nextdraw module in "plot" mode, to plot SVG without
using a separate SVG file.

Run this demo by calling: python plot_inline.py


This is a short example to show how one can:
* Import the NextDraw module
* Compose a string containing SVG -- what would be an SVG file *if* we saved it.
* Plot that SVG string with the NextDraw.
